# API Password Setup Module

## Description

This project is a Node.js-based module that allows users to securely create and manage passwords for patients in a healthcare system. The application provides an interface where patients can input their medical record number (Mr_no) and date of birth (DOB) to set or update their password. It uses MongoDB to store patient data and EJS to render forms.

The project also utilizes session management and flash messages to provide user feedback during the process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/api_password_setup.git

2. Usage
Start the server:

After setting up the environment variables, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will start on the port specified in your .env file (default is port 3002).

Access the application:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3002. You will see the input form where users can enter their MR number and Date of Birth (DOB) to reset or set their password.

Features:
Form submission: Patients submit their MR number and DOB to the /password/:Mr_no route, where their information is validated against the database.

Password reset: If valid, the patient can set a new password.

Flash messages: Users are notified with success or error messages using flash messaging (e.g., "Passwords do not match", "Please check your details and try again").


3. Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required for the project. Set them in the .env file:

PORT: The port on which the app runs (e.g., 3002).
DB_URI: The MongoDB URI for database connection (default: mongodb+srv://admin:admin@mydevopsdb.5hmumeq.mongodb.net//).
DB_NAME: The name of the MongoDB database (e.g., Data_Entry_Incoming).
SESSION_SECRET: A secret key used for session management (replace your_secret_key with an actual secret).
REDIRECT_PORT: The port for the redirection after successful password setup (e.g., 3055).
